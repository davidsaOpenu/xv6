/**
 * `obj_disk` specify the most lower level in the object file system.
 * This layer is responsible to communicate with the object storage device.
 *
 * Object file systems use a table containning the objects meta data. The
 * table has the following structure:
 * |
 *
 * In our implementation we assume the table is software implemented. Some
 * hardware devices can implement it in the hardware level to improve
 * performance and relaiability. By implementing the table outselfs, the only
 * requierment we have from the hardware is being abale to request any bytes
 * we want in random access method. Especially without any aligment. Still,
 * hardwares have maximum transaction size. For example, we can only write X
 * bytes in a single request. This X is usually 4KB but the implementation
 * would be generic.
 *
 * In the implementation we assumed that the super-block is located in the
 * first bytes of the storage device. This object DOES located in the objects
 * table and has an id of 0. The objects table is an object as well.
 *
 * The hardware has a table which saves mapping between object id to its
 * address and its size. This limitaion is hardware dependent and should be
 * set when creating the file-system on specific drive. The size of the table
 * is saved in the super-block of the file system as well as the position of
 * it.
 *
 * Hardware Mock
 * =============
 * In the current implementation, we use a "mock" storage device which saves
 * the data in the RAM. In future projcets, we can integrate with real
 * hardware and only this file would change. It would become asynchrony and
 * handle hardware interrupts. The output interface this layer exports is
 * object based only. Hence, it doesn't matter for upper layers, if the
 * storage device handle the objects table itself or the kernel does it.
 * When changing to interrupt-implemented driver, we could extend upper levels
 * in the file system as well. For example, the logbook layer - more details
 * on that in the relevant files.
 *
 * As we mentioned before, each transaction has a maximum size. Hence, when
 * writing large objects to the disk (or reading them) we need to split them
 * into smaller requests. This implementation depends on the interrupt
 * handling flow that communicates with the hardware. Hence, we didn't add
 * such logic to the mock implementation. We do the transaction from start to
 * end in a single operation.
 *
 * The inner implementation has the following structure:
 * The memory is an array of size `STORAGE_DEVICE_SIZE` which must be defined.
 * The super block is located at offset 0 and the table right after it.
 *
 * Futher improvments
 * ==================
 * Currently, the objects table is implemented in a naive way of storing the
 * object's name as it's id. In the future, better implementation can be
 * implemented. One such implementation would use hash method on the name.
 * This hash method should be collision-free (sha256 would be sufficient
 * here). This would provide us the abillity to find the object without
 * full scanning the objects-table. In addition, this method would set all
 * the ids to be with the same length in bytes.
 * Because we currently doesn't use such method, we set an upper length for
 * the objects name. Hence, a relevant error can occour when calling
 *
 * In the current version, the disk is NOT thread safe.
 * TODO make it a thread safe.
